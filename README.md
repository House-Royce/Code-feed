Design and implement a **Blog / Forum / Photo Album / Audio Album using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, REST**. Your project must meet all the requirements listed below.

### Forum
**Required** functionalities:
*	**View** all questions / categories (optionally with paging).

*	Implement **ranking** according to user activity.

##Requirements
*	Use **JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX** – the major part of your work should be JavaScript written by your team
  *	**Front-end:** use **HTML5, CSS3** to create the content and to style your Web application
  *	**Back-end:** use **REST API** from Parse.com / other BaaS provider / your own back-end REST service
  *	Focus on the front-end, which should be written in JavaScript
*	**Work in team** – all team members should contribute
  *	**Use GitHub** or other source control system as project collaboration platform
  *	**Each team member should have commits in 5 different days**
*	Publish your project **live in Internet** – your project should be public in Internet
  *	You may **share your project** to get external feedback
  *	Most shared and commented projects will get additional **bonus score**
*	**Valid and high-quality JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML and CSS**
  *	Follow the best practices for JavaScript Application development. Structure your code well
  *	Validate (when possible) your HTML (http://validator.w3.org) and CSS code (http://css-validator.org)
  *	Follow the best practices for **high-quality JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS**
*	**Usability, UX and browser support**
  *	Your web application should be easy-to-use, with intuitive UI, with good usability
  *	Ensure your Web application works correctly in the latest HTML5-compatible browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari (latest versions, desktop and mobile versions)
  *	You do not need to support old browsers like IE9

### Forbidden Techniques and Tools
You should **write your application from scratch**. You are **not allowed** to use:
*	Existing projects and frameworks like CMS systems, forum systems, photo album systems, etc.
*	Single Page Apps frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, etc.
*	JavaScript APIs for accessing the server-side data. **Use REST, JSON and AJAX calls**.

##Deliverables
Put the following in a **ZIP archive** and submit it (each team member submits the same file):
*	The complete **source code** of your project (JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, images, scripts and other files).
*	A **presentation** of your project (e.g. PowerPoint slides) of your project. It should provide the following information:
  *	Project name and purpose – what you have created?
  *	Team name, list of team members.
  *	Contributions of each team member.
  *	Technical description.
*	Any other information (optionally).

##Public Project Defense
Each team will have to deliver a **public defense** of its work in front of the other students, trainers and assistants. Teams will have **only 10 minutes** for the following:
*	**Demonstrate** the web application (very shortly).
*	Show the **source code** and explain how it works.
*	Explain how each team member has **contributed**: display the commit logs in the Source Control System you are using.
*	Optionally you might prepare a **presentation** (3-4 slides).
Please be **strict in timing**! On the 10th minute you **will be interrupted**! It is good idea to leave **the last 2 minutes for questions** from the other students, trainers and assistants.
Be **well prepared** for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time.

##Assessment Criteria
*	**Functionality** (all the required functionalities according to the type of project you choose) – 0…7
*	Correct use of **AJAX, REST and JSON** for accessing the server-side data – 0…3
*	**Code quality** (well-structured code, split into modules and files, good naming, formatting, etc.) – 0…5
*	**Security** (correct data validation, absence of cross-site scripting / unescaped data in the UI, etc.) – 0…2
*	**Teamwork*** (GitHub used; each team member contributed in 5 different days; distribution of tasks) – 0…3

\* If not all team members have contributed to the project, this does not affect the Teamwork points.

##Give Feedback about Your Teammates
You will be invited to **provide feedback** about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously** and be honest.
